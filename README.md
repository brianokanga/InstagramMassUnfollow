# InstagramMassUnfollow
This bot i wrote in selenium and python is capable of unfollowing mass number of users on instagram 
<h1>====================================</h1>
<h1>#How to Use Must Read:</h1>
This is a python script and you must have <br>1-python installed <br>2-enviornmental variables setup<br>
 3-Your screen resolution must be  1366*768<br>4- Selenium module installed  "pip install selenium" <br>5-Py auto gui module installed "pip install pyauto gui"<br>you cant use your pc while this script is running because it will simulate 
mouse clicks at certain positions <br>
<h1>====================================</h1>
<h1>-i have written the script so that most of the possible error will not affect it very much and it should be good 
to go. 
I recommend that you dont extend the limit of the unfollowers to more than 200 as instagram will block them after some time moreover if you think that the process is too slow thats because i made this bot for 24/7 use and you shouldnt increase the rate as it will imply to instagram that you are using a bot i myself tested it for one whole day with no major errors .</h1>
